# Titanic-Kaggle-Problem

My first attempt at solving Titanic problem on Kaggle using very basic data analysis and Logistic Regression.
The current approach has an accuracy of 83%.

For further improvement in accuracy :
	
* Use a better alternative to LogisticRegression 
* Perform data analysis to find combined effects of attributes on survival rates
